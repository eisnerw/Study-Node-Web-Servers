# Node Web Servers Study

<br>

## What is Node Web Servers Study?
Node Web Servers Study is a study in the construction of a basic web server WITHOUT frameworks like express.  Suffice to say that implementing express applications is MUCH easier, however taking a little bit of time to study web servers without express provides a great deal of insight into what happens underneath the hood.  If you would like to see the express study of this particular project, please take a look.

## Does the Node Web Servers Study feature commentary?
Yes! I use extensive Commentary (mostly in the form of my thought process) so that the new and curious can follow the logic in the program and get an idea of my reasoning behind each and every line of code.  In addition to my line-by-line commantary, I also provide a Process text file that gives a good outline of my design and implementation process.

## What are the key features of the Node Web Servers Study?
Since this study is ongoing, basic functionalities are covered first and more advanced features are added or will be added in the future.  I divided this particular study into different branches covering different aspects of basic node servers, which i list below:


| **Features:**                            | **Feature Notes:**                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------|
| basic web server                             |  see nodeWebServer               |
| basic web server with pages                             |  see nodeHttpWebServer                |
| Web server with fully functioning site                            |  see basicServerSite               |
